Just a small commandline-based tool for cleaning downloaded CS assignments from UWaterloo's Seashell for archival.

In the Computer Science program at the University of Waterloo, we are required to use an online C editor called Seashell. It allows us to download a zip file of our assignments, but the zip contains several Seashell-specific log files and project settings, as well as common files across all assignments.

This tool exists to just clean up the downloaded, extracted zip file so it can be pushed to git for archival.
